# Binary Heaps #

A Binary Heap (a type of Priority Queue) 


## Big - O Runtimes ## 
Assuming the Heap is of size N, the runtimes are as follows: 

|Big - O  | Insert    | Remove Min | Find Min / Max| 
|---------| --------  | ------     | --------------|
| Worst   |  O(log N) |  O(log N)  | O(1)          |
| Average |  O(log N) |  O(log N)  | O(1)          |
