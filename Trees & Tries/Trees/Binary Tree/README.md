# Binary Tree #
A Binary Tree is a dynamic set data structure holding Node objects, like Linked Lists, however with each Node containing an element, a
reference to a Left Child Node and a reference to a Right Child Node. In a Binary Tree, each parent node cann hold no more than 2
child nodes. 

## Big - O Runtimes ## 
Assuming the Binary Tree is of size N, the runtimes for each Binary Tree operation is as
follows: 

|Big - O  | Insert    | Remove | Find | 
|---------| --------  | ------ | -----|
| Worst   |  O(1)     |  O(N)  | O(N) |
| Average |  O(1)     |  O(N)  | O(N) | 

So, the Binary Tree offers approximatey the same runtime as using a regular old array object.
